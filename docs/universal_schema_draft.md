# Universal Civil Knowledge Schema (UCKS) — Draft v0.1

> The goal: a clean, minimal format to capture domain knowledge across
> the entire AEC spectrum — buildings, infrastructure, facilities — independent
> of any existing standard, that can be exported to IFC, COBie, gbXML, CityGML, LandXML, and others.

## Scope

Unlike IFC (which tries to encode everything in one monolithic schema) or gbXML (which only
covers energy), UCKS captures **core domain knowledge** that spans:

| Sector          | Examples                                      | Existing Standards       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Buildings       | Walls, slabs, doors, HVAC systems             | IFC, COBie, gbXML        |
| Infrastructure  | Bridges, roads, railways, tunnels             | IFC 4.3, LandXML         |
| Facilities      | Equipment, maintenance zones, asset registers | COBie, Maximo             |
| Urban/GIS       | Sites, parcels, terrain, utilities            | CityGML, InfraGML        |

The schema doesn't try to replace these — it provides a **clean canonical layer** that
captures the essence of each concept, then exports to whichever format is needed.

## Design Principles

1. **Domain-first** — model what things *are*, not how a file format represents them
2. **Sector-agnostic** — same primitives work for a wall, a bridge pier, or a pump
3. **Minimal** — only the primitives needed to express AEC knowledge
4. **Graph-native** — maps directly to nodes and edges in a knowledge graph
5. **Human-readable** — YAML as the authoring format, JSON as the interchange format
6. **Export-agnostic** — no IFC-isms, no COBie-isms; exporters handle the translation

## Core Primitives

| Primitive         | What it represents                              | Example                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Entity**        | An AEC concept / element type                  | Wall, BridgeDeck, Pump, Road     |
| **PropertyGroup** | A logical cluster of related properties        | CommonProperties, ThermalProperties, LoadProperties |
| **Property**      | A single measurable/describable attribute      | Thickness, SpanLength, FlowRate  |
| **Relationship**  | How entities relate to each other              | contains, bounds, connects, serves |
| **DataType**      | Value type for a property                      | Real, String, Boolean, Enum      |
| **Enumeration**   | A fixed set of allowed values                  | {INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, NOTDEFINED} |
| **Sector**        | The AEC sector                                 | Building, Infrastructure, Facility |
| **Domain**        | A knowledge area / discipline within a sector  | Structural, Mechanical, Geotechnical |

## Graph Model (Neo4j)

When loaded into Neo4j, UCKS becomes:

```
(:Entity {id, name, description, domain})
    -[:INHERITS_FROM]->(:Entity)
    -[:HAS_PROPERTY_GROUP]->(:PropertyGroup {id, name})
        -[:HAS_PROPERTY]->(:Property {id, name, data_type, unit, required})
            -[:HAS_CONSTRAINT]->(:Constraint {type, value})
            -[:HAS_ENUMERATION]->(:Enumeration {id, values})
    -[:RELATES_TO {type, cardinality}]->(:Entity)
```

## Why Not Just Use IFC?

IFC 4.3 has ~1,400 classes because it tries to cover everything. The result:
- Massive schema that's hard to implement correctly
- Properties scattered across PropertySets, Attributes, and Type objects
- Software vendors implement subsets differently → data loss during exchange
- Adding a new concept requires an ISO standardization process

UCKS is different:
- **Additive** — a domain expert can define a new entity in 20 lines of YAML
- **Clean** — one entity, its properties, its relationships. No indirection layers
- **Queryable** — the graph structure enables natural language queries out of the box
- **Exportable** — the "dirty" complexity lives in exporters, not in the knowledge itself

## Next Steps

1. **Validate schema design** — review with advisor, iterate on primitives
2. **Define core entities across sectors:**
   - Building: Wall, Slab, Beam, Column, Door, Window, Space, Building, Storey, Roof
   - Infrastructure: Bridge, BridgeDeck, BridgePier, Road, Alignment, Tunnel
   - Facility: Pump, AirHandlingUnit, Sensor, DistributionSystem, MaintenanceZone
3. **Build UCKS → Neo4j ingestion** — load YAML definitions into the graph
4. **Build UCKS → IFC exporter** — generate IFC-compatible output from the graph (first export target)
5. **Integrate with Gemini agent** — add a tool that lets the AI help define new entities conversationally
6. **Build UCKS → COBie exporter** — second export target to prove the pivot works
7. **Cloud library UI** — web interface where users can browse, query, and contribute entity definitions
